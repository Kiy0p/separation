In 1929, a Hungarian named Frigyes Karinthy established the theory of 
six degrees of separation: every person in the world can be connected 
to any other person via a chain of individual relationships, that has 
no more than six links. Nowadays, social networks makes it easy to 
evaluate the degree of separation between two individuals, and to 
test this theory.

Starting from a file containing people's names (example.txt), the 
goal was to find how many relatins separated them.
